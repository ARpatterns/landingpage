# Community Page for AR Patterns

## Run Locally

Steps:

1. Clone the repository: `git clone git@github.com:ARpatterns.git`
2. Install the dependencies: `npm install``
3. Run `npm run dev` to reload the page automatically when a file changes, or run `npm run build`, then `nmp run serve` to output the files to the dist folder, then npm run serve to serve the content from that folder.

## Structure

TBD

## Contribution Guidelines

CSS: 

We're working with Sass, Scss. Have a look at the documentaion: 

on macOS you can install the necessary tooling via Homebrew:

```
brew install sass/sass/sass

```

Run the build script to generate the new (main.css) file

```
sass assets/sass/main.scss assets/css/main.css
```
