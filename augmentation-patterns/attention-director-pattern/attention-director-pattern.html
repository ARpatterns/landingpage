					<h2>What is the Attention Director Pattern?</h2>
					<p>
						An attention director uses animated pointers (bubbles, arrows), light rays, or spatial sound to
						direct where users should pay attention if the relevant area is not visible or not in focus.
					</p>
					<p>
						The is especially useful for any kind of navigation use-case. But it is also useful in
						conjunction with other AR patterns such as the <a
							href="/augmentation-patterns/geolocated-remark-pattern/geolocated-remark-pattern.html">Geolocated
							Remark Pattern</a>, the <a
							href="/augmentation-patterns/ahead-staging-pattern/ahead-staging-pattern.html">Ahead Staging
							Pattern</a> and <a
							href="/augmentation-patterns/pass-through-portal-pattern/pass-through-portal-pattern.html">Pass-Through
							Portal Pattern</a>,the or the <a
							href="/augmentation-patterns/tag-along-pattern/tag-along-pattern.html">Tag Along
							Pattern</a>].
						All these patterns have in common that they place augmentations in an AR scene which may fall
						out of the camera's field of view.
					</p>
					<p>
						The attention director pattern is a very versatile pattern that can be used in almost any
						context where directing the user's attention is required as the primary use caseâ€”such as
						navigation applications-or to improve usability-such as in conjunction with other AR patterns.
					</p>


					<h2>Requirements</h2>
					<p>
						The attention director pattern applies whenever there is a directional indicator in AR that
						points to the location of a virtual or real entity relative to the current position and
						orientation of the user's device. For example, if an AR augmentation to the right of the
						smartphone screen's current, the attention director must be able to understand the relative
						positioning, even if the user's position or the phone's orientation change. Therefore, spacial
						and rotational awareness is a prerequisite for the pattern to work. In addition, the directional
						indicator must initially be placed in ahead of the user in order to be visible. It may then move
						with the screen (similar to the <a
							href="/augmentation-patterns/tag-along-pattern/tag-along-pattern.html">Tag Along
							Pattern</a>) or stay in place with a world-locked anchor
						(Such as in the <a
							href="/augmentation-patterns/ahead-staging-pattern/ahead-staging-pattern.html">Ahead Staging
							Pattern</a>). However, in the context of this pattern it does not
						matter if the directional indicator is positioned as a UI element in 2D, as a fake-3D billboard
						or as a 3D object.
					</p>
					<ul>
						<li>Anchored: screen-space or not applicable</li>
						<li>Placed: initially ahead of user</li>
						<li>Aligned: pointing towards point of interest</li>
						<li>Camera: typically rear</li>
					</ul>
					<h2>Related Patterns</h2>
					<ul>

						<li>
							<a href="/augmentation-patterns/tag-along-pattern/tag-along-pattern.html">Tag Along
								Pattern</a>The Tag Along Pattern has the intention of placing an augmentation anchored
							in the user's position. It is a general pattern for things that follow the user but appear
							within the AR scene, while the Attention Director pattern may also follow the user, but
							specifically aims at directing the user's attention.
						</li>
						<li>
							<a href="/augmentation-patterns/ahead-staging-pattern/ahead-staging-pattern.html">Ahead
								Staging Pattern</a> This pattern shares the property of positioning an augmentation
							ahead of the user, but generally does not have the intention of navigating the user's
							attention to any specific place. However, once an augmentation is placed, the Ahead Staging
							Pattern and the Attention Director Patterns are often used together.
						</li>
					</ul>
					<h2>Technical Considerations</h2>
					<p>
						The attention director pattern requires that the AR device be aware of it's positional as well
						as rotional information in order to point into the correct direction.
					</p>
					<p>
						Depending on the attention object, the position is either relative to a world-locked anchor or a
						GPS position.
					</p>
					<p>Special consideration is required to distinguish two separate cases to achieve good usability:

					<ul>
						<li>When far from the target: While far, distance indicators help improve orientation, to give
							the user an indication whether they have to cover distance or whether they are already
							close.</li>
						<li>When near to the target: When near the target may just be outside of the camera's viewport.
							In this case, it is important to display that the target is reached, and to give very
							precise indication in which direction the camera must be turned to find the target.</li>
					</ul>
					Depending on the use case, world tracking or GPS tracking may be better suited
					</p>
					<h2>Scenarios and Examples</h2>
					<ul>
						<li>Navigation: Navigation apps in general are primary uses of this pattern, being able to
							overlay directional information over the real world, such as in car headboards, phone
							navigation apps or logistics (picker navigation)</li>
					</ul>
