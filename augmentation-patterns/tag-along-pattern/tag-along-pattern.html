					<h2>What is the Tag-Along Pattern?</h2>
					<p>An augmentation following the Tag-Along pattern always moves together with the user (it tags
						along). Typically, such an augmentation also always attempts to stay within the user’s view
						range. The main advantage of tag-along augmentations is that they ensure the presented
						interaction elements are always visible and easily accessible to the user.</p>
					<p>A Tag-Along augmentation is typically oriented towards the user’s position, centered on the
						user's face or device, using billboarding techniques. User interface components in AR
						applications are a typical example of this pattern: These UI elements must stay within the
						user's view range while also being located within the AR scene.</p>
					<p>In AR applications for head-mounted displays, tag-along augmentations are usually designed to fit
						within the user’s arm-length range, ensuring they can interact with the elements without
						stretching or straining themselves.</p>

					<h2>Requirements</h2>
					<p>Tag-Along augmentations move with the user and are attached to the user's position within the AR
						scene, facing the user's face or, more generally, the camera. This ensures the augmentation
						stays within the user's view. Depending on the application, the augmentation may mirror the
						user's movements more or less closely.</p>
					<p>
						We differentiate between two types of movement constraints:
					</p>
					<ul>
						<li><strong>Synchronized: </strong>The augmentation always mirrors the user's look-at direction,
							as if the user were wearing a head-mounted display. This is useful in games, such as
							first-person shooters, where the augmentation needs to move fluidly with the user’s
							perspective.</li>
						<li><strong>Free: </strong>The augmentation stays in place within the scene even when the user
							moves their head up or down (y-axis), tilts (yaw), or rotates. The user may manually
							reposition the augmentation or simply turn back to where it was positioned. This free
							behavior, which is independent of head movement, is helpful in applications like 3D design,
							where the augmentation should not obstruct the user’s view but can be repositioned when
							needed.</li>
					</ul>
					<p>
						Tag-Along augmentations are not used in every scenario where something moves with the user. For
						example, a virtual dog walking beside the user is better suited for the <a
							href="/augmentation-patterns/ahead-staging-pattern/ahead-staging-pattern.html">Ahead Staging
							Pattern</a>
						and <a href="/augmentation-patterns/captured-twin-pattern/captured-twin-pattern.html">Captured
							Twin Pattern</a>, as the virtual dog adjusts to environmental features (ground, walls,
						etc.) and is anchored in the scene, not to the user.
					</p>
					<ul>
						<li>Anchored: on user</li>
						<li>Placed: constraint ahead of usert</li>
						<li>Aligned: constraint towards user</li>
						<li>Camera: rear-facing</li>
					</ul>
					<h2>Related Patterns</h2>
					<ul>
						<li><a href="/augmentation-patterns/hand-palm-pop-up-pattern/hand-palm-pop-up-pattern.html">Hand/Palm
								Pop-Up Pattern: </a> While also primarily useful for UI components, this pattern
							attaches elements to the user's hand instead of centering them on the user's position.</li>
						<li><a href="/augmentation-patterns/ahead-staging-pattern/ahead-staging-pattern.html">Ahead
								Staging Pattern: </a>In the Ahead Staging Pattern, augmentations are initially placed ahead
								of the user, but they are world-locked and do not move with the user. See the virtual
								dog example in the Requirements section for a more detailed explanation.</a></li>
					</ul>
					<h2>Technical Considerations</h2>
					<p>
						Designing Tag-Along augmentations presents several technical challenges because their frequent
						use in AR, XR, and VR applications has created high expectations for usability. A Tag-Along
						augmentation stays with the user and is not world-locked but is attached to the scene’s camera.
						Some key considerations include:
					</p>
					<ul>
						<li><strong>Scene Interactions: </strong>Typically, Tag-Along augmentations do not collide with
							the environment or respond to scene lighting. To ensure that UI elements remain visible,
							it’s important to treat Tag-Along augmentations separately from the rest of the AR scene by
							always drawing them on top of other content. They should also avoid responding to scene
							lighting to remain optimally readable. However, in entertainment apps where visual
							consistency is key, these augmentations might break immersion, and a narrative reason may
							need to explain their presence (e.g., attached to a helmet). In some cases, in-scene
							lighting might be used to help them blend better into the environment.</li>
						<li><strong>Movement Constraints: </strong> It’s essential to decide how closely the
							augmentation mirrors the user’s movements and to what degree it is constrained. Synchronized
							constraints, where the augmentation follows the user's look-at direction, can help in games,
							while free constraints, where the augmentation remains stationary as the user moves, are
							useful in design programs. UI elements typically remain upright, avoiding tilt along the x-
							and z-axes to help the user maintain orientation. The position along the y-axis is also
							often constrained, keeping the augmentation at a comfortable level (e.g., hip or face
							level), even if the user bends or crouches.</li>
						<li><strong>Presence: </strong>Users need clear feedback to understand which UI element or scene
							they are currently interacting with. Visual cues, haptics, and sound are essential in
							ensuring smooth interactions. For example, the concept of <a
								href="https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10108763">tomato presence</a> ensures that
							users know which button they are pointing at before accidentally pressing it. Similarly,
							haptics and audio feedback can assist users in navigating the interface and enhance their
							sense of presence.</li>
					</ul>
					<h2>Scenarios and Examples</h2>
					<ul>
						<li><strong>User Interfaces: </strong>The "Near Menu" UX component of the <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-gb/windows/mixed-reality/mrtk-unity/mrtk3-overview/">Mixed Reality Toolkit</a> is a good example of the Tag-Along pattern, where menus remain within the user's view and are easily accessible at all times.</li>
						<li><strong>Gaming: </strong>In first-person shooter games, HUD elements that follow the player's movement and remain visible in their field of view use the Tag-Along pattern to ensure quick access to important game information without obstructing the player’s view of the game world.</li>
						<li><strong>Design Applications: </strong>In 3D design apps, the Tag-Along pattern can be used for tool menus that are kept accessible but can also be moved or hidden to prevent cluttering the user’s workspace.</li>
