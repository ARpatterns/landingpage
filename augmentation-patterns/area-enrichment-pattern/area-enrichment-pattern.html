					<h2>What is the Area Enrichment Pattern?</h2>
					<p>
						The Area Enrichment pattern is to replace and overlay parts of the camera image with an
						augmentation.
					</p>
					<p>
						This pattern applies whenever detected parts of an image (an area) is replaced (enriched) with
						an AR augmentation. With the Area Enrichment Pattern the intention is to spacially project 3D
						content in to the detected area in order to create an alternate reality. However, it is less
						common than the <a
							href="/augmentation-patterns/segment-overlay-pattern/segment-overlay-pattern.html">Segment
							Overlay Pattern.</a>
					</p>
					<p>
						Area Enrichment is a technique which may be encountered in any context where blending reality
						and AR augmentations are beneficial. For example, virtual backgrounds in conferencing
						applications or reality-altering effects in photography and video applications are typical
						applications of the area enrichment pattern.
					</p>
					<h2>Requirements</h2>
					<p>
						The area enrichment pattern requires an image segment (area) that can be augmented with AR
						content (enrichment). The enrichment is typically aware of the segment's spacial orientation,
						and uses it to populate the calculated space with virtual items.
					</p>
					<ul>
						<li>Anchored: not applicable</li>
						<li>Placed: on image segment</li>
						<li>Aligned: any, but often oriented towards user</li>
						<li>Camera: any</li>
					</ul>
					<h2>Related Patterns</h2>

						<li><a href="/augmentation-patterns/segment-overlay-pattern/segment-overlay-pattern.html">Segment
								Overlay Pattern: </a>The segment overlay pattern typically applies for dynamic segments
							such as faces, text or other image segments that are recognized with image recognition
							techniques.</li>
						<li><a href="/augmentation-patterns/superimposition-pattern/superimposition-pattern.html">Superimposition
								Pattern: </a>If the purpose of the AR augmentation is to superimpose a replacement of a
							specific object rather than creating a 3D area to populate it with virtual objects, the
							Superimposition pattern applies.</li>

						<li>
							<a
								href="/augmentation-patterns/anchored-supplement-pattern/anchored-supplement-pattern.html">Anchored
								Supplement Pattern: </a>Anchored supplements differ in two aspects: They do not rely on
							image segmentation but rather feature recognition, and they never have the intention of
							replacing content, but rather to supplement it with additional information.
						</li>

					</ul>
					<h2>
						Technical Considerations
					</h2>
					<p>
						The Area Enrichment Pattern uses detected image segments to calculate the spatial 3D area
						resulting from perspective projection of the segment into depth of space. The calculated 3D area
						can then be used to populate the space with virtual items.
					</p>
					<h2>Scenarios and Examples</h2>
					<ul>
						<li>
							Video Conferencing: Virtual Backgrounds
						</li>
						<li>
							Video or Photo Effects: Changing scene reality, and combining it with other patterns such as
							Superimposition, Staged Progression or Ahead Staging.
						</li>
